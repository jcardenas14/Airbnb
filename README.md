# Austin Airbnb - Using Data to Gain a Competitive Edge

### Introduction
Making your home available on Airbnb can be an intimidating prospect, particularly if you live in a large, hip city where you're forced to compete against thousands of other listings. Such is the case in Austin, TX - a city consistently ranked among the top in the US and among the fastest growing, a city that is swiftly changing to accommodate the influx of technology, a city where keeping it weird is and will always be a higher calling, a city that is my hometown. Though I no longer live in Austin, when I came across the Airbnb data for the city, I was intrigued to take a deeper dive in. The primary question I'm setting out to answer: Which factors provide a home with a competitive edge? In other words, how do you actually get people to choose your home, enjoy their stay, and leave a review? Let's see what the data has to say.
